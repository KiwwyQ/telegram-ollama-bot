"""
Personality and prompt construction.

Two prompt fragments are always combined for every request:
  1. The *personality* (default friendly assistant, or a custom one set by the
     user in DMs / by an admin in groups).
  2. The *tool instruction* (always present) describing how the model may use
     the web search / GIF / file tools via the text protocol.

Language preference and participant names are appended dynamically by the
handler that builds the final system prompt.

    "- GIF: include [GIF: search term] on its own line when a GIF would improve the "
